WebSockets allow for full-duplex communication. This can also mean bi-directional communication. The server can initiate communicatation
with the client when its connected and vice-versa. This is in contrast to http that only allows the client to initiate communication.

Websocket is a separate protocol from HTTP.

A websocket holds a persistant connection between client and server.
